# Concepts
import Todo from "../../components/Todo.astro"

- Environment: "places" in which values can be stored
- Frames: A table (possibly empty) of bindings, which associate variable names with their corresponding values
- Procedure: a pair consisting of some code and a pointer to an environment
  - Procedures are created in one way only: by evaluating an $\lambda$-expression
  - **Code** is obtained from the text of the $\lambda$-expression
  - **Environment** is the environment in which the $\lambda$-expression was evaluated to produce the procedure

# The Rules for Evaluation

- Rule 1: A procedure object is applied to a set of arguments by constructing a frame, binding the formal parameters of the call, and then evaluating the body of the procedure in the context of the new environment constructed.
The new frame has as its enclosing environment the environment part of the procedure object being applied.
- Rule 2: A lambda-expression is evaluated relative to a given environment as follows:a new procedure object is formed. combining the text (code) of the lambda-expression with a pointer to the environment of evaluation.

# Actions and Identity
- We say that an action. A. had an effect on a object, X, (or equivalently, that X was changed by A) if some property, P. which was true of X before A because false of X after A
- We say that two objects. X and Y, are the same if any action which has an effect on X has the same effect on Y
